# Biography

I'm a student at UCSB graduating in June with my M.S in computer science. I'm interested in all things AI. I like to think about neural networks, how to design them, how to train them, and what's wrong with them. In my spare time I follow neuroscience and genetics as I suspect natural phenomena holds the key to building our robot overlords.
