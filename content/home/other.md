I play Dance Dance Revolution at a professional level and run a DDR club at UCSB. I love to introduce new friends to the sport so you can expect I will find an excuse to take you to the arcade with me :).

I took classical piano lessons for 8 years and have been playing for 15+ years. I write and perform covers to popular songs, compose my own music casually, and love sharing music with friends and being introduced to new genres.

I am a U.S. citizen and natively bilingual in English and Farsi. I know a hint of Spanish and am interested in learning Chinese.
