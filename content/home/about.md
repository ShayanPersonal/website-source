# Biography

I am a computer science student at University of California, Santa Barbara currently participating in a 5-year accelerated BS/MS program. My interests lie around recent work in artificial intelligence. In particular I am interested in the design of neural networks for vision and natural language processing tasks. I find inspiration in dynamical neuroscience and evolutionary algorithms.

I am currently looking to participate in a research internship or residency in AI. Feel free to contact me.
