I play Dance Dance Revolution at a professional level and run a DDR club at UCSB. I love to introduce new people to the sport so you can expect I will find an excuse to drag you along to the arcade with me â˜º.

I took classical piano lessons for 8 years and have been playing for 15+ years. I write and perform covers to popular songs, compose my own music casually, and love meeting people who are also passionate about music even if I don't agree with their tastes :).

I also took martial arts lessons in Soo Bahk Do for 8 years and am ranked ee-dan (2nd-degree black belt). I have not practiced since my late teens but would love to get back into some form of martial arts.

I am a U.S. citizen and natively bilingual in English and Farsi. I know a hint of Spanish and am interested in learning Chinese.
